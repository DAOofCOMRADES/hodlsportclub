        "description": "One thousand years later, the world will be full of wild species known as Hodlers. They would consistently attack others with no regard for consequences. In times of glut, they would hodl more and more and more. In times of poverty, they would inject fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) everywhere they went, making others quickly sell all valuables in a panic. Instead of giving themselves names, they would refer to each other by number. It was every Hodler for themselves, and the concept of order and community was nowhere in sight. One day, a young Hodler decided that it wanted to see a difference. It gave itself a name: Sunta Urías. Sunta realized that every Hodler for themselves was not something that could sustain growth and progress. Sunta toiled over this thought, gained a following, and created what is now known as the Hodl Sport Club when Sunta came of age. Sunta split the following into six Platoons — Gridiron, Ataman, M240, B187K, Alpha, and Bravo — each necessary for the club to survive and prosper. As time progressed, these six platoons formed into countless subdivisions, each with its own story of emergence and promise for the future, and that future begins now.",
